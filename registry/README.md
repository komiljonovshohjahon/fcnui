### `fcnui` Registry App: Your Visual Playground for Component Exploration

The `fcnui` Registry App is a simple Flutter application; it's a gateway to exploring and implementing new components with ease and efficiency. Designed as a visual playground, this app provides developers with a comprehensive environment to preview and integrate `fcnui` components seamlessly.

### How to use:
- Create a new component inside `ui/default_components`
  - The component must start with version commented. See `button.dart`
- Export your component in `default_components.dart`
- Copy the newly created component (note: copy using `IntelliJ` based IDEs), then paste to `index.json` located in `ui/app/api/registry/ui/` package.
