# shadcn-ui for Flutter

Welcome to the Flutter port of shadcn-ui, a component library originally made for React developers. This project aims to bring the power and flexibility of shadcn-ui to Flutter developers, allowing them to easily integrate beautiful and customizable components into their Flutter applications.

## Packages

This project consists of the following packages:

### cli

The `cli` package is a Dart-based CLI tool that streamlines the process of working with shadcn-ui for Flutter. It contains all the necessary commands to initialize a project, add new components, and manage dependencies efficiently.

### flutter_cn_ui_package

The `flutter_cn_ui_package` package is the heart of shadcn-ui for Flutter. Written in Dart (Flutter), it provides developers with a comprehensive set of dependencies and default components. With this package, integrating stunning UI elements into your Flutter applications becomes seamless.

### registry

The `registry` package is a Flutter application designed for testing shadcn-ui components individually. This app serves as a visual playground where developers can explore and interact with each component in isolation. By including the `flutter_cn_ui_package`, the registry ensures that components are thoroughly tested and ready for integration into real-world projects.

### ui

The `ui` package is a Next.js application that complements shadcn-ui for Flutter. It provides an API for all the components in JSON format, enabling seamless integration with the `cli` tool. By offering a user-friendly interface for accessing component information, the `ui` package enhances the development experience for Flutter developers using shadcn-ui.
