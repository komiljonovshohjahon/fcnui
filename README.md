## Packages

This project consists of the following packages:

### cli

The `cli` package is a Dart-based CLI tool that streamlines the process of working with `fcnui`. It contains all the necessary commands to initialize a project, add new components.

### fcnui_base

The `fcnui_base` package is the heart of `fcnui`. Written in Dart (Flutter), it provides developers with a comprehensive set of dependencies.

### registry

The `registry` package is a Flutter application designed for testing `fcnui` components individually. This app serves as a visual playground where developers can explore and interact with each component in isolation. By including the `fcnui_base`, the registry ensures that components are thoroughly tested and ready for integration into real-world projects.

### ui

The `ui` package is a `Next.js` application that complements `fcnui`. It provides an `API` for all the components in `JSON` format, enabling seamless integration with the `cli` tool.

That's it! You're now ready to leverage the power of `fcnui` in your projects. Happy coding! ðŸš€
